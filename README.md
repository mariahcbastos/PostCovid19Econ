# PostCovid19Econ
# Project abstract
On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus and has changed the world as we know it. The Novel Corona Virus forced entire countries to shut down with countries like Italy, Spain and France being hit exceptionally hard. An economic catastrophe shortly followed. In this analysis, we take a look at different sectors of the European economy to find key indicators of what may be expected in the Post-Covid world.  

# Problem statement 
Economies world-wide are experiencing extreme downturns with some of the worst coming from countries in Europe. It is imperative that with new data coming in everyday in a rapidly evolving environment, that we analyze the economy before Covid-19 as well as the economic change that has occurred during Covid-19 in order to make an accurate prediction of what can be expected in Post-Covid recovery. 

# Description
Taking data from Eurostat, a European statistics partnership with National Statistical Institutes and other national authorities in the EU Member States, known as the European Statistical System (ESS), we preform a variety of regression analyses along with a time series analysis on different key components of the European economy in order to make an accurate prediction of what may be expected in the European Post-Covid 19 economic recovery. 

# Conclusion
There is a weak positive correlation between Interest Rate and Cumulative Cases of COVID19, as the correlation is 0.3. This means that as COVID19 casesincreased so did the intrest rate in Europe. This is intrestesting to find because in the United States, as a response to the COVID19 economic crisis, the Fed cut interest rates to zero.
